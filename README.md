# HI

I am currently self-teaching myself frontend development. After I reach a point of satisfaction with my skillset, I plan on moving onto backend. Not sure what will come after that.

> Heck maybe I'll go to college or something

I love software development, it's really cool. Also, I want to be able to feed my family
